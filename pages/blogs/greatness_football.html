            I was movtivated to write this while thinking about the debate of the best striker on the planet right now. Undoubtedly, 
            the current big three rigth now is, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erling_Haaland&oldid=1317535725">Erling Haaland</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9&oldid=1316578965">Kylian Mbappe</a>, and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry_Kane&oldid=1317559379">Harry Kane</a>. Each with 14 goals in 
            10 games, 14 goals in 10 games, and 19 goals in 11 games respectively. Each of them has begun the 2025/2026 season with 
            red hot form, banging in goals left, right and center. 
        </p>

            Now, looking at the broader picture. How did we determine that these three strikers are the greatest in the world? 
            Obviously their G/A contribute a great deal to the discussion. Some may say the eye test and the aesthetic of each player
            matters a whole lot. For me, I think we have to return the to most fundamental aspect of a competition. Winning. Because 
            the most important factor for a great player is <b>their contribution to winning</b> on the biggest stages. Because what
            good are you doing if you don't win. Furthermore, how pivotal they to the winning ways of their team. Because every player 
            contribute to winning to some shape or form. But only the greats are irreplaceable. For example, as of the releasing of 
            this article, Erling Haaland has scored all of Manchester City's last 7 goals. Without Haaland, City will still function 
            of course. But would they function as well as second place in the Premier League table? I'm not so sure. 
        </p>

            Additionally, if we look at football history the greatest players are always the ones who "carry the team". To be the 
            carrier, players have to be irreplaceable usually in multiple facets of the game. Look at Thibaut Courtois in the 
            penultimate match against Liverpool for the title of Champions of Europe. Courtois put on a masterclass in shotstopping. 
            And it's because of nights like these that Courtois is considered one of the greatest by many. Pick any great players 
            off the top of your mind. There will be one night or one tournament where it seems like nothing could stop them. For the 
            greatest, they do this consistently. Night in night out.
